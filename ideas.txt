The main idea of the project:
    A web application using flask. The core idea being that user enters the website and can upload an mp3 file and choose some filter/action. 
    I will then process send the file to backend where it will be processed and modified using c. The user can then download the new file.

Core technologies:
    Python, Flask, C

Where and how will i deploy this website?
    A VPS (Virtual Private Server) gives you full control over Flask, C execution, and file handling.

Integrating C:
    *   Compile your C code and run it using Python's subprocess module.
    *   If you want to directly call a C function inside Python, you can use ctypes.
