The main idea of the project:
    A web application using flask. The core idea being that user enters the website and can upload an mp3 file and choose some filter/action. 
    I will then process send the file to backend where it will be processed and modified using c. The user can then download the new file.

Core technologies:
    Python, Flask, C

Where and how will i deploy this website?
    A VPS (Virtual Private Server) gives you full control over Flask, C execution, and file handling.

    Recommended VPS Providers (Low-Cost Options)
    Provider	    Cheapest Plan	Specs	                    Estimated Cost
    Linode	        $5/month	    1GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 25GB SSD	$5/month
    DigitalOcean$   4/month	        512MB RAM, 1 vCPU, 10GB SSD	$4/month
    Vultr	        $5/month	    1GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 25GB SSD	$5/month

Integrating C:
    *   Compile your C code and run it using Python's subprocess module.
    *   If you want to directly call a C function inside Python, you can use ctypes.

Just focus on searching for a single thing at a time from file/frames, while keeping in mind what the overall structure might evolve into. The point is that I need to extract a bunch of data and return it. I should naturally start from the beginning of the frame and find everything I can before moving on inside the frame.
